# Search for Light Weight Time Series Classification Deep Learning Models using Two-Dimensional Input Features and Automated Exploration

In this study, a method was proposed to find the optimal combination of input features and model architecture for each dataset. The proposed approach utilized various existing image encoding methods such as Recurrence Plot, Gramian Angular Summation Field, Gramian Angular Difference Field, Markov Transition Field, Continuous Wavelet, and time series decomposition using moving averages to create 13 input features. Additionally, a hyperparameter optimization framework was applied to automatically explore the combination of input features and model architecture for each dataset. The time series classification deep learning model with exploration applied is referred to as Broad CycleMLP. Applying the proposed method to Broad CycleMLP resulted in an average reduction of 68.76% in parameter usage and an average increase of 7.22% in classification accuracy across 85 UCR datasets.
